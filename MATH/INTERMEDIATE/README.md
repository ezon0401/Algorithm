## Math Trivia

- Euler's Phi Function 
    - ϕ(n) is the number of K that satisfies 1 <= N <= K and gcd(N, K) = 1
    - ϕ(n) = n * product of (1 - 1/P) for every prime factor P of N.

- Fermat's Little Theorem
    - If P is a prime number, pow(X, P) ≡ X (mod P).
    - Furthermore, if X is not a multiple of P, pow(X, P-1) ≡ 1 (mod P). In other words, pow(X, P-2) is a modular inverse of X.
