# Overview

This repository aims to introduce algorithms for problem-solving.
Each repository includes an algorithm explanation and related problems.
An algorithm explanation will include Python sample code.

Each file is an answer code for the corresponding problem.
There are three types of file names starting with the following prefix:

1. BOJ - Problems from Baekjoon Online Judge. 
2. CF - Problems from CodeForces. 
3. ABC (or ARC) - Problems from AtCoder.


## Progress

* Regularly updating solutions and adding explanations
* Organizing a file structure
    * Planning to put algorithms in order based on the level of difficulty
